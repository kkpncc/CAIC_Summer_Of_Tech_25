Challenges that I attempted and approcah(es) is used 

1. Problem at starting 
2. Hidden in crowd
3. Locked Vault
4. Log explore
5. I also solved a problem where i just had go into some directory and read a file in it 



1. Problem at starting 
It was straight forward , flag was there

2. Hidden in crowd
I had usse ssh command then there was directory then i had many files ,
I tried to think maybe file name has some hint first like it might have ctf/flag/fl4g in name
but that didnt worked that i opend hidden files then i was able to find the flag

3. Locked Vault
In this challenge there were three files , I had to change permissions to get password for the
other file and also had make them executable to execute them but when i tried to use password 
that i got from file1.sh it didnt opend file2.sh so i used cat command and show inside of the file
and found that i had use password from file2.sh to XOR with certain string in file3.sh to get flag so 
i did that but timer was close i didnt got submitted in within time


4. Log explore
I had to download the file then , had to get a log.txt file i was 16 Gb in size notepad cant open it , 
and my terminal cant open it with cat command so i had to use find ctf thing inside file but it said it is binary 
so i  used grep and rrad binary as text to find dcCTF{} type of text in file and i got the flag
